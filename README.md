<h1> About the Game </h1>
This is the web version of my previous uploaded game "Buzzy_Mosquito" at a separate repository with all its latest updates and bug fixes.

<h2>How and where to play it </h2>
Move your Cursor up or down on the screen for controlling the y axis of mosquito in the game in order to help dodge the electrified badminton in the game ^^
This game doesn't have any delta time so the game's performance is totally device dependent the game gets too slow if ran on a low performing device. So do ensure
1. Getting your device pluged in if it's batter percentage is low
2. Try playing on Laptop or Computer if possible. However you can play on some smart phones too without any major issues.
